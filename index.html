                    <h3 id="Background">A Little Background</h3>
                    <p>I grew up in Lawrence, KS. I'm an only child but have never been 'alone' as my imagination keeps me company and takes me everywhere. Both my parents have creative backgrounds. My dad, a communications design major, and my mom, a theater minor with a masters in English.</p>
                    <p>My parents own Englewood Florist in Lawrence and this coming March 2023, they will have been in business 30 years. I am very proud of them.</p>
                    <p>I've been encouraged all my life to do & be who I want. In high school I realized I could try this <em>artist</em> thing out. I had only used Photoshop but went running full speed into a Graphic Design degree.</p>

                    <h3>A Brief History</h3>
                    <p>I studied Graphic Design at Drake University and received my BFA in 2007. I started right away as a Pre-press Designer for a small printing company in Des Moines, IA.</p>
                    <p>After my 2nd design job, I had learned that fixing other people's digital art and documents wasn't helping me grow. I also learned that "art-on-demand" wasn't something I was able to keep up with and enjoy. 2 years into the journey, I move from Iowa back home to Kansas.</p>
                    <p>An indirect path from a Graphic Design degree to selling insurance and then participating in a hack-a-thon at a previous employer's event, I caught the coding "bug". I've worked as an IT business partner for many years, a subject matter expert (SME) for many projects including robotic process engineering (RPA), I finally decided being a partner and SME on the business side isn't enough. <strong>I want to be solving the problems and helping business teams come up with solutions they haven't considered yet.</strong></p>

                    <p>I do not own a flat surface that is not covered in paper or art projects, other than the little space in front of my keyboard and to the right for my mouse. I have been a crafter, creator, creative my entire life. I will create an art portfolio page soon.
